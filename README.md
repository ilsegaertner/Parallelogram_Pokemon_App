# PokeScript/Parallelogram


Pokemon app created with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and styled with CSS as part of CareerFoundry's Full-Stack Web Development course. This simple app loads data from an external API - the [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/), displays each object on a separate button and shows further details in a modal.

### About

The goal of this project was to learn basic JavaScript (variables, functions, arrays, DOM interaction, AJAX, etc.) in the beginning of the course. 

After the implementation of the API I created an updated version using Bootstrap and jQuery, and published the app via [GitHub Pages](https://ilsegaertner.github.io/parallelogram/).

### What I learned

I learned many things in the process of building the app. Probably the most crucial one: 
The arising conflicts when it comes to designing and programming at the same time. If I'd start again, I'd separate these tasks strictly.
