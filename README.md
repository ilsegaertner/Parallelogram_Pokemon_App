# Parallelogram: A Pokémon Web App

PokeScript/Parallelogram is a Pokémon application developed using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as part of CareerFoundry's Full-Stack Web Development course. This app leverages data from the [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) external API, displaying each Pokémon object on a separate button and providing further details in a modal.

### Context

The primary objective of this project was to gain proficiency in fundamental JavaScript concepts, including variables, functions, arrays, DOM interaction, and AJAX, at the onset of the course.

Following the initial implementation of the API, I created an enhanced version utilizing Bootstrap and jQuery. The app is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://ilsegaertner.github.io/parallelogram/).

### Challenges

Building this app provided invaluable learning experiences. One significant lesson was the challenge of balancing design and programming simultaneously. In hindsight, I recognize the importance of strictly separating these tasks to minimize conflicts and streamline the development process.
