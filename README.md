# About

Pokemon app created with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and styled with CSS as part of CareerFoundry's Full-Stack Web Development course. This simple app loads data from an external API - the [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/), displays each object on a separate button and shows further details in a modal.

The goal of this project was to learn basic JavaScript (variables, functions, arrays, DOM interaction, AJAX, etc.) in the beginning of the course. To see the hosted website, click [here](https://ilsegaertner.github.io/parallelogram/).

After this exercise I created an updated version using Bootstrap and jQuery, and published the app via [GitHub Pages](https://ilsegaertner.github.io/parallelogram/).

I learned many things in the process of building the app. Probably th most crucial one in the arising conflicts when it comes to designing and programming at the same time. If I'd start again, I'd separate these tasks strictly.
