# About

Pokemon app created with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and styled with CSS as part of CareerFoundry's Full-Stack Web Development course. This simple app loads data from an external API - the [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/), displays each object on a separate button and shows further details in a modal.

The goal of this project was to learn basic JavaScript (variables, functions, arrays, DOM interaction, AJAX, etc.) in the beginning of the course. To see the hosted website, click [here](https://ilsegaertner.github.io/parallelogram/).

After this exercise I created an updated version using Bootstrap and jQuery, and published the app via [GitHub Pages](https://ilsegaertner.github.io/parallelogram/).

Link to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ilsegaertner/parallelogram).

I learned many things in the process of building the app. Probably th most crucial one in the arising conflicts when it comes to designing and programming at the same time. If I'd start again, I'd separate these tasks strictly.

1) A brief description of the project. You can use the project brief or README file as inspiration. In your description, try also to reflect on your work by answering the following questions (you don't need too much detail; the key points are fine):
2) A screenshot to represent the project.
3) A link to the project’s GitHub repository.
4) A link to the live, hosted version of your app (if possible). If you don’t have a live version, include screenshots that show the app’s functionality or a recording of your app in use.
5) A list of the technologies used for each project (React, CSS etc. — again, you can pull this from your README file).
6) Any other relevant materials you created for the project; for example, user flows, user stories, and/or a Kanban board. Be sure to explain how you worked with these materials during the project.
